How to add new corpus:

1) First make a folder under our git folder (so that everyone can reach the new data sets). Name the folder to something appropriate. E.g. "./HT15_AI_Project_Group43/NewCoprusWithAppropriateName".
2) Add one or two data files to be used by the corpus into the newly created folder.
3) Open up the "nltk_utils.py" file with your favourite text editor (mine is either Vim or Sublime).
4) In the function decleration "def get_corpus(corpus_):" add another elif statement:
	elif corpus_ == "NewCorpusName":
		corpus = ...
5) The "..." in step 4) are to be replaced with an appropriate CorpusReader for your data type (for regular txt-files with plain text in them use: PlaintextCorpusReader(...))
6) Since "nltk_utils.py" is placed in the same folder as your data file use the root "./NewCoprusWithAppropriateName" and then a regex to find those files ('.*\.txt' for txt files worked).
7) Save all changes and try running your code with "python main.py -c NewCorpusName" and cross your fingers.
8) When you've reached step 7) and it works, add as many data files as you can manage inside the same folder as in 1) to improve on the performance.
9) You're done, stop reading and go do some corpus work...
